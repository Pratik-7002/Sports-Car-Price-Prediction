# Sports-Car-Price-Prediction

Overview: In this project, I conducted predictive analysis to forecast sports car prices using machine learning techniques. By leveraging Python for data cleaning, preprocessing, and modeling, along with seaborn and matplotlib for visualization, I developed a robust predictive model to accurately estimate the prices of sports cars.

Key Contributions:

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: I performed thorough data cleaning and preprocessing on the Sports Car Price Dataset using Python. This involved handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies to ensure the quality and integrity of the data. Additionally, I conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the underlying patterns and relationships within the dataset.

Model Development: Utilizing machine learning algorithms, I implemented a Random Forest Regressor model with feature engineering and scaling techniques. Through careful feature selection and engineering, along with scaling to standardize the features, I optimized the model's performance. The resulting model achieved an impressive 95% accuracy in predicting sports car prices, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing the complexities of the dataset.

Visualization and Insights: To effectively communicate the model predictions and insights to stakeholders, I employed seaborn and matplotlib to create visualizations. These visualizations helped convey the predictive trends and actionable insights derived from the analysis, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions regarding pricing strategies and market positioning.

Technologies Used:

Python (Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn)

Seaborn

Matplotlib

Outcomes and Impact: The predictive analysis of sports car prices provided valuable insights for stakeholders in the automotive industry. By accurately forecasting sports car prices, the model facilitated informed decision-making regarding pricing, inventory management, and marketing strategies. The project's success underscored the importance of data-driven approaches in optimizing business outcomes and enhancing competitive advantage.

Key Learnings: This project enhanced my proficiency in data cleaning, preprocessing, machine learning modeling, and data visualization techniques. Additionally, it reinforced the importance of feature engineering and model optimization in improving predictive accuracy. Furthermore, it highlighted the significance of effective communication and visualization in conveying complex analytical findings to non-technical stakeholders.
